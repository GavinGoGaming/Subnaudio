## Subnaudio
A next.js project for making Subnautica PDA Audio & Notifications.

This webapp allows you to make audio similar to the PDA character from the video game Subnautica.
It uses the free Amy voice from [TextReader](https://textreader.pro/) with Audio API effects to make the voices.

A standalone instance is viewable [here](https://pages.gavingogaming.com/Subnaudio/).

### Hosting
Simply fork the project and run:
```
npm start
```
or, to develop:
```
npm run dev
```

You can also host via Github Pages. Set it to "Actions" mode and run the built in action.
